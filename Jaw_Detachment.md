## Jaw Detachment

**Introduction:** 
In odontology various treatments are performed for each patient's bite, for which, a study and observation of each particular case is required, since each denture is different. It is intended to optimize the procedure in time, resources and personnel by developing a computational tool that can digitally display and manipulate the dentures of each patient (digital articulator). For this procedure to be successful, there is a step that is crucial, it is about untying the jaw of the skull in such a way to be able to identify the axis of the mandibular joint by tracking all this bone. The goal of this project is by recibing a 3D images of a human skull as the input, detach the jaw in a different image and give it as the output.
