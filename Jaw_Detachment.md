**Idea and Introduction:** 
Currently a lot of 3-D medical imaging reconstruction takes a lot of 
computational power and tends to only provide a "pretty picture" and does 
not provide any additional information for diagnostics  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2698114/">(source)</a>. 
Since edges often highlight the details of images, an edge based approach to medical 
imaging reconstruction hopes to increase the diagnostic potential of 3D medical images, 
and to reduce computational needs for 3D image reconstruction. Note that medical images are 
often conducted in 2D slices that move through a volumetric portion of a patient (Thus 3D views can be made from these 2D slices).
