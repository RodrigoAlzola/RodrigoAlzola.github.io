##  ESG Scores in Latin American Markets 

**Introduction:** 
Latin America is an emergent focus for inversion and innovation. The idea that countries are still young tells that many things
are left to do and to exploit, making it an interesting point for economic growth. Although all this good inversions opportunities, 
Latin America is branded as an irregular market. The diverse problems like social outbreaks, corruption, government instability, environmental damage, etc;
give the investors less trust to put there money in Latin America stocks. But as it's say, the bigger the risk the bigger the reward. For this reason is vital to analyse all the companies under different scopes, being environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) the most relevant ones. The goal of this project is make the analysis under this three aspects for more than 100 Latin American companies and see how they affect in there discount rate.

**Methods and Materials:**
This project requires knowledge in big data, financials and econometrics. 
To analyse the return of a company the discount rate has to be calculated. HOLT employs a total system approach to measuring and forecasting corporate returns (for more information see <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781119440512.ch7">Beyond Earnings</a>). In this project the HOLT discount rate for every company is taken from _Credit Suisse_. 

All the code was implement in Python. 

**Development:**
ESG refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business.
These criteria help to better determine the future financial performance of companies, return and risk. We made a questionnaire of 101 questions related to ESG and we make all the analysts to answer it for every company that trades in the stock market of Latin America. With the we determine the next equeation:
