##  ESG Scores in Latin American Markets 

**Introduction:** 
Latin America (LA) is an emergent focus for inversion and innovation. The idea that countries are still young tells that many things
are left to do and to exploit, making it an interesting point for economic growth. Although all this good inversions opportunities, 
LA is branded as an irregular market. The diverse problems like social outbreaks, corruption, government instability, environmental damage, etc;
give the investors less trust to invest in LA stocks. For this reason is vital to analyse all the companies under different scopes,
being environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) the most relevant ones. The goal of this project is to make the analysis under
this three aspects for more than 100 LA companies and see how they affect in the companies discount rate.

**Methods and Materials:**
This project requires knowledge in hardware/software engineering, computer vision, biotechnology and product design. 
The principal materials for this product were:
- Raspberry Pi
- RGB LED strips
- Logitech C920 Webcam

All the develope was made in Python with Linux OS and late develop in Debian OS. 

**Development:**

(*Hardware design*):
In innovation is essential to understand the concept of "viable minimums". It means to reach the most requirements for satisfying a product with the minimum materials and time. First prototype was developed with the use of a Raspberry Pi.

The second prototype was a much more close to the final product. At this stage the client starts already testing the product, so that correction and modifications can be performed.

(*Software design*):
In automatic image analysis, it is common to find the problem of detecting simple Ô¨Ågures such as straight lines or circumferences. The first approach to detect the halos was to use what is called the Hough transform. This method give some good results, but the model wasn't robust. It has a high rate of false positive detections or detect the smallest pharmaceuticals discs which there is not interest in find it.

As this approach is not trustworthy I decide to do an intensive image analysis. Applying a simple threshold and filters is easy to detect the borders of the halos because of there contrast. Choosing 3 points in the line of the halo is possible to calculate the radius and the center of a circle and represent the whole circumference (for more information see <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/equation-of-circle-when-three-points-on-the-circle-are-given/">Circle from three points calculator</a>). Also for the analysis I take advantage of the geometry of the problem as the samples are always going to have 6 halos separated in the same way for performance agility.

For the final product a basic GUI was develope. It make the analysis via streaming, controlling the levels of light and filter values.  

**Results:**
This is the final version of the machine, this one was delivered to the client:

A robust image anlyisis to detect halos was implement with a frendly interface for automatisation of pharmaceutical mesurments. The final results is show next:

**Conclusion:**
Having been able to invent a machine from scratch was something extremely entertaining and challenging. This project was requested by the Chemical Analyisi Center of Universidad Catolica, Santiago, Chile. After all requirements were satisfy the machine was delivered to the client and a training was performed in the Chemical Analysis Center to introduce the product to the officials.
